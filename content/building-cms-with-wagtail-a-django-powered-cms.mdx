Wagtail is a modern CMS built on top of Django, offering an intuitive interface for content creators and powerful features for developers. In this post, we'll explore Wagtail's features, such as page models, streamfields, and the built-in editor.

```python
from wagtail.core.models import Page
from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel
from wagtail.core.fields import RichTextField

class BlogPage(Page):
    introduction = RichTextField(blank=True)
    body = RichTextField()

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('introduction'),
        FieldPanel('body'),
    ]
```

Wagtail is highly customizable, allowing you to build a CMS that suits your project's needs. We'll discuss how to extend Wagtail with custom models, create a user-friendly admin interface, and integrate third-party packages like Wagtail's search module.
