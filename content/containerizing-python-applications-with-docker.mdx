Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. This post will guide you through containerizing a Python application using Docker. We'll cover writing Dockerfiles, managing images, and deploying containers.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Docker makes it easy to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments. We'll also discuss Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications and how to deploy your containers to cloud providers like AWS or Azure.
