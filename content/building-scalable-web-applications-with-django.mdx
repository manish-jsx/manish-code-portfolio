Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. This post explores the core features of Django, such as models, views, templates (MVT), and the powerful ORM. We'll build a simple blog application, focusing on best practices for scalable web development.

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

Django's ORM is one of its key strengths, allowing developers to work with databases in a Pythonic way. We'll also cover user authentication, admin customization, and deployment strategies for production environments.
