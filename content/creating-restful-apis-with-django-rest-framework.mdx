Django Rest Framework (DRF) is a powerful toolkit for building Web APIs. This post will guide you through creating a RESTful API for a blog application. We'll discuss serializers, views, routers, and how to handle authentication and permissions.

```python
from rest_framework import serializers, viewsets, routers
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from .models import Post

class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ['id', 'username', 'email']

class PostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Post
        fields = '__all__'

class PostViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Post.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PostSerializer

router = routers.DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'posts', PostViewSet)
```

We'll also cover how to set up token-based authentication and permissions to protect your API endpoints. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a robust API that can be consumed by frontend or mobile applications.
