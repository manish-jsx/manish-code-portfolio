summary: "An overview of FastAPI, its features, and how to build high-performance, asynchronous APIs."

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. This post will introduce FastAPI, show how to build an API, and discuss its benefits for asynchronous programming.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException

app = FastAPI()

items = {}

@app.post('/items/{item_id}')
async def create_item(item_id: int, name: str):
    if item_id in items:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail='Item already exists')
    items[item_id] = name
    return {item_id: name}

@app.get('/items/{item_id}')
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    return items.get(item_id, 'Item not found')
```

FastAPI's automatic generation of OpenAPI documentation, support for asynchronous requests, and ease of use make it an excellent choice for modern web APIs. We'll also discuss how to deploy FastAPI applications and integrate them with existing Python projects.
