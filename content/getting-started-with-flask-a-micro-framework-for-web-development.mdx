Flask is a micro web framework for Python that's easy to get started with and perfect for small to medium-sized web applications. In this post, we'll dive into the core concepts of Flask, such as routing, templates, and request handling, and we'll build a simple blog application.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

posts = []

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html', posts=posts)

@app.route('/post', methods=['POST'])
def post():
    title = request.form['title']
    content = request.form['content']
    posts.append({'title': title, 'content': content})
    return redirect(url_for('index'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, we create a simple blog application with Flask that allows users to add posts. We'll also discuss how to structure larger applications, manage configurations, and extend Flask with useful extensions.
